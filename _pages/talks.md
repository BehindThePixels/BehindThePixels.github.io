### High-Performance, Low-Overhead Rendering with OpenGL and Vulkan
_GPU Technology Conference 2016_

As advanced games and applications continue to push the performance envelope, developers look to their 3D APIs for improved predictability, threading and reduced CPU load. New extensions to OpenGL and a totally new 3D API Vulkan are answering these requests directly. This session introduces and details both of these approaches a shows how applications can use OpenGL "AZDO" (Approaching Zero Driver Overhead) extensions like NVIDIA's Command Lists to greatly reduce single-threaded CPU overhead while reusing existing OpenGL code. Going further, the second section introduces the new 3D API from Khronos called Vulkan. Finally, there is a discussion of the tradeoffs of extended OpenGL and AZDO versus Vulkan, and how a developer might choose between them.
