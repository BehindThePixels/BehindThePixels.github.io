# About Me

I am Edward(Shiqiu) Liu, a huge graphics enthusiast. Currently I work as a Developer Technology Engineer at NVIDIA Corporation.

Fascinated by graphics at first sight, I spent most of my college career at South China University of Technology writing software renderers from scratch. Later I joined the graphics lab at Georgia Institute of Technology as a graduate student, working on fluid simulation and rendering. Now at NVIDIA, I work on exploring cutting-edge rendering techniques that could improve the visual quality and performance of future graphics applications.

I used to be an intern at Microsoft Research Asia and Tencent, where I worked on GPU based video codec and gaming. 

I love photographing, singing and basketball, and here is a video of me getting the 3rd prize of National English Speech Competition in China: http://contest.i21st.cn/article/speaking/1061_1.html

If you have any questions or things that want to discuss with me, please don't hesitate to contact me.
